        <h2>2. Understanding Laser Hair Removal</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 What is Laser Hair Removal?</h3>
        <p>Laser hair removal is a medical procedure that uses concentrated beams of light (lasers) to remove unwanted hair. The process targets the pigment in hair follicles, effectively damaging them and inhibiting future hair growth.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Benefits of Laser Hair Removal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-lasting results:</strong> Unlike traditional methods like shaving and waxing, laser hair removal offers permanent reduction in hair growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Lasers can selectively target dark, coarse hairs while leaving the surrounding skin undamaged.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Each laser pulse takes a fraction of a second and can treat multiple hairs at once. Small areas, such as the upper lip, can be treated in under a minute.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. The Laser Hair Removal Process at The Aesthetic Loft</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Pre-Treatment Guidelines</h3>
        <p>To ensure optimal results, clients are advised to avoid sun exposure, tanning beds, and certain medications that can increase skin sensitivity in the weeks leading up to their appointment.</p>

        <h3>4.2 The Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Preparation:</strong> The area to be treated is cleaned, and protective eyewear is provided.<br>
            <strong>Laser Application:</strong> A hand-held device emits laser light onto the targeted area. The sensation is often described as similar to a rubber band snap, and cooling devices are used to minimize discomfort.<br>
